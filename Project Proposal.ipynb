There are demand problems that do not meet the increasing popularity of rideshare and also distribution problems although the Citi bike rideshare system has already deployed hundreds of thousands of bikes, there are situations where users are not able to find bikes at destined bike stops. This implies that a study about the usage of rides to solve the redistribution problem might be urged.\n","\n","2.

New York City is the most crowded city in the U.S., and if having as many cars per household as other cities, the traffic situation would become worse. As the article mentioned, “we need to learn more and more into — opening up public spaces, getting out of our cars, focusing more on public transportation. This is the way of the future, unquestionably” This also leaves a question for public transportation developers - how to spend the money most efficiently so that can best serve the public needs of New York City citizens?\n","\n","3.
